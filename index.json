Note This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extended Markdown syntax of LoveIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Our goal is to solve potential problems in the field of artificial intelligence and traditional computer security in the context of the rapid development of computer technology in the new environment of the 21st century. Our team hope to ensure privacy information at the same time, actively explore the new direction of the development of the era of big data, trying to solve security faced by machine learning under the wave of new problems, and hope to be able to put forward new theory, to promote the development of in the computer field is then mature technology applied to information security in all areas of life, in turn, to promote the development of society and progress. We have published many outstanding achievements in high-level academic conferences and journals at home and abroad. At the same time, our team also has exchanges and cooperation with Chinese Academy of Sciences, Huawei, ZTE, Datang Telecom and other units. The research group has sufficient funds, and the research team regularly organizes academic and outdoor activities. It not only provides the international leading scientific research environment, but also creates a good living atmosphere for students. Our research group has close cooperation with overseas first-class universities such as Hong Kong Baptist University, Nanyang Technological University, CIFAR Research Institute, Kyushu University, George Mason University, Virginia Tech University, and National University of Singapore.

Researchers are scrambling to keep up with the requirements. In particular, “Privacy by Design” is integral to the GDPR and will likely only gain in popularity this decade. When using privacy preserving techniques, legislation suddenly becomes less daunting, as does ensuring data security which is central to maintaining user trust. Data privacy is a central issue to training and testing AI models, especially ones that train and infer on sensitive data.We are also actively exploring the direction of perfect privacy AI.

Weak artificial intelligence is good at simulating and extending human intelligence in specific fields and within limited rules. Strong AI has consciousness, self-awareness and innovative thinking, and can think, plan, solve problems, think abstractedly, understand complex concepts, quickly learn and learn from experience, and other human-level intelligence work; Superartificial intelligence (AI) is a machine intelligence that vastly exceeds human intelligence in all fields. The security connotation of ARTIFICIAL intelligence includes: (1) reduce the security risks brought by the immaturity and malicious application of artificial intelligence to cyberspace and national society; (2) Promote the deep application of ARTIFICIAL intelligence in the field of network security and public security; (3) Build an ARTIFICIAL intelligence safety management system to ensure the safe and steady development of artificial intelligence.

With the rapid development of science and technology, the rapid nonlinear growth of data has brought strategic opportunities for the development of big data. Among them, 2015 is the peak of big data development, and the state has announced the behavioral strategy of big data development. Because big data represents the direction of advanced productivity, it has become an unstoppable trend. However, the current situation of big data security is not very good, there are a lot of hackers through various means to obtain government, enterprise and personal privacy data, in recent years, there are many big or small privacy leakage problems. With the development of mobile Internet and cloud services, the network boundary has disappeared, and traditional defensive and detection-oriented security protection measures have become inadequate, and big data security has faced challenges. At present, the main difficulty is that it is difficult to apply for access from users in an effective way and it is difficult to detect and control the behavior of developers.

Multimedia data is characterized by a large amount of information, strong correlation, and high redundancy, resulting in the limitations of high computational complexity and high power consumption in security solutions. Our team aims to deepen the academic research on multimedia information security and improve the reliable security guarantee of its production, transmission, distribution, and application.

User identity management is to use appropriate technologies to manage user identities. In this way, users must be authenticated each time they request to access resources, which enhances security. AccessControl refers to the means by which the system limits the ability of users to use data resources by restricting their identities and the predefined policy groups to which they belong. Network security refers to the ability to identify and eliminate unsafe factors in the network environment. Data security is mainly to encrypt data with limited means to achieve the purpose of data protection. The core of management security lies in the establishment of security management standards for cloud services, which define the boundary conditions of security management and the linkage mode between operators and users. So as to realize cloud service availability management, vulnerability management, patch management, configuration management and time emergency response, etc. Virtualization technology is the key core technology to realize cloud computing. Cloud architecture providers on the cloud computing platform using virtualization technology can provide security and isolation guarantees to their customers. Virtualization technology is the key technology to fully integrate and efficiently utilize various computing and storage resources. Virtualization is the creation of virtualized (versus real) versions of certain objects, such as operating systems, computer systems, storage devices, and network resources.
